# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare. This is a beginner-friendly project that uses the **Titanic dataset**, which is commonly used to teach machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The Titanic dataset contains various features of the passengers such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket Class
- Fare
- Cabin
- Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- Number of Parents/Children Aboard

The target variable is whether a passenger survived or not (`Survived`).

## Modeling Techniques

The project uses the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features and survival rates.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, such as family size or grouping ages.
4. **Model Training**: Various machine learning models are used:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curves.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd titanic-survival-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the notebook cells step by step to see the data analysis, model training, and prediction process.

Or run the Python script:

```bash
python titanic_survival_prediction.py
```

## Results

- The model achieves an accuracy of **X%** using [best-performing model].
- Precision, recall, and F1 scores were also computed for each model.
- Feature importance was analyzed to understand which features contributed most to the prediction of survival.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to classic datasets to predict outcomes based on various features. The Titanic dataset is a useful beginner project to learn the basic steps in building a classification model.
